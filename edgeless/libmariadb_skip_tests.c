// This file disables tests in libmariadb that are incompatible with our
// changes. Unit tests in libmariadb define an array "my_tests" where you can
// set the field "skipmsg" to disable a test. As libmariadb is a submodule that
// we don't want to touch, we add this file to the executables (see
// CMakeLists). The array is then modified at runtime.
